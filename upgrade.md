# Upgrade

## Initial scenario

A RHEL 8.6 (Edge) image has been created with the following packages:

* **podman**
* **slirp4netns**
* **net-tools**
* **setroubleshoot-server**

The image has been deployed using a [kickstartfile](rhel8edge.ks) which deploys a [containerized application](quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest)

A RHEL 8 server was used to create the image.

## RHEL 9 image

To upgrade the above a RHEL 9 image has been built with the same packages.

 A RHEL 9 server was used to create the image.

## Apache Server

An apache server has been used to serve:

* Kickstart file
* RHEL 8 image
* RHEL 9 image
